# Code Refactor Starter Code

The purpose of this project is to refactor the codebase of the Horiseon landing page so that it meets accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines.

# Goals

Both goals were achieved by the following methods:
1. by ensuring that all images have <alt> tags.
2. by substituting semantic HTML elements such as <section>, <nav>, <header> and <footer> for numerous, non-descriptive <div> elements
3. by ensuring that all links worked efficiently
4. by consolidating and reorganizing CSS sectors and properties
5. by including comments before each element or section of the page
